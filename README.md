# What is this repo?
This is a repo I am using to learn the basics of rust, it has a launch and task config
these config files should allow for the use of the run shortcut key to run rs files

create an rs file and hit the run button: ```ctrl + f5``` on windows

On this branch the rust analyzer works giving proper warnings and errors after the rust-analyzer indexes all the files
